  ## Description 
  This application allows a user to create, update, delete products, categories, and tags within a mySQL database. Each product generated is given a unique id that is auto incremented by the database code. Each product has the potential to be linked to a particular tag ID as well as a particular Category. The coding for this project encompasses Model, View, Controller as well as the Object Relational Mapping. Each object is seperated into a separate file which allows for separation of concerns. i Still have a very surface level understanding of how ORM works and have spent the last few days trying to understand how sequelize uses the javascript code to produce a functional object inside of a database. Still have so far to go but so grateful for how far I have come.
